# Omega-ThMkr

Omega Theme Maker, make themes for Omega, without pain.

## Why ?

Before, when making a theme, you had to recompile the whole firmware to test your changes. Now you don't need anoymore.

## How does it works ?

This is an adapted version of [this](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega/pull/501/commits/f6aee50127ce5aaf57989126fb2ddcd9611642a2). Instead of setting the colors as consts, we kindly ask emscripten to provide them.

This means the icons aren't currently editable.
