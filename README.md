# Omega-ThMkr

Omega Theme Maker, make themes for Omega, without pain.

## Why ?

Before, when making a theme, you had to recompile the whole firmware to test your changes. Now you don't need anoymore.

## How does it works ?

This is an adapted version of [this](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega/pull/501/commits/f6aee50127ce5aaf57989126fb2ddcd9611642a2). Instead of setting the colors as consts, we kindly ask emscripten to provide them.

This means the icons aren't currently editable.

## How the f* do I use this thing ?
On the left side of the interface, you will be able to find all the color related code from the OS, and you will then be able to change
the hexadecimal values in order to change the color of the different elements of the interface. If you want to see how the colors fits in, you just have to press the "play" button to launch the simulator.
the "file" icon next to the play button will allow you to save your work.
